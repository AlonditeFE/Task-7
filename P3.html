        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Persona 3 follows a group of high school students trying to cope with, understand and accept death in a world surrounded by it, as well as find their own reasons for living. They form a group called SEES in order to investigate the Dark Hour, a mysterious time period between one day and the next that few people are aware of. During the Dark Hour, SEES explores Tartarus, a large tower containing Shadows, creatures that feed on the minds of humans. To fight the Shadows, each member of SEES is able to summon a Persona, a manifestation of their inner self.</p>
        <h2>Plot</h2>
        <p>Set in 2009, Persona 3 begins with the protagonist returning to the city of Tatsumi Port Island ten years after his parents died from an accident. He is introduced as a transfer student that has just moved into the Iwatodai Dormitory, but arrives late. A mysterious boy, calling himself Pharos, introduces himself to the protagonist and asks him to sign a contract that states he will accept full responsibility for his own actions.</p>

        <p>He is quickly brought into SEES (Special Extracurricular Execution Squad), a club at Gekkoukan High School which disguises itself as a completely normal after school club, when his awareness of the Shadows and the Dark Hour is revealed. The Dark Hour is a secret hour which only a select few with the "potential" are aware of; the rest "transmogrify" into coffins. Shadows are also causing many people to become victims of Apathy Syndrome, a mysterious condition that puts them into a vegetative trance-like state in which they lose the will to live; victims are referred to as "the Lost."</p>

        <p>The protagonist discovers that he can summon multiple Personas into battle. After awakening to his Persona ability, the protagonist is transported to the Velvet Room, which its proprietor, Igor, says is a realm between "dream and reality." Igor explains to him that his Persona ability is special: he is the only member of SEES capable of wielding multiple Personas in battle due to possessing the Wild Card. In-game, the Velvet Room is where the protagonist may fuse two or more Personas to create a new one. Igor also encourages the protagonist to meet people and form bonds with them, which are known as Social Links. According to Igor, the power of his Social Links will determine his potential in combat.</p>

        <p>With the help of their Personas, SEES is able to explore a mysterious tower called Tartarus, which mysteriously manifests during the Dark Hour at Gekkoukan High School. They must also defeat Greater Shadows that appear every full moon and attack the city, believing that by killing all twelve of them, they will be able to end the appearance of the Dark Hour. SEES summons Personas using gun-shaped items called Evokers by shooting themselves in the head, an action reminiscent of suicide.</p>

                <h1 id="makoto">Makoto Yuki</h1>
                <h2>Design</h2>
        <p>The protagonist has dark blue hair unkempt at the front, blue eyes and a light build, being shorter than average. His bangs cover his right eye. He is often shown with his hands in his pockets (except when holding weapons), leaning slightly back. He frequently listens to his earphones. Shigenori Soejima designed the protagonist first and formed designs for other characters around him. He maintains an air of neutrality, keeping with the supposed tradition of the Megami Tensei franchise that the player is the hero, while giving off an air of coolness. Earlier designs had him looking mature and collected, based on the trope of "cliche cool guy."</p>

        <p>At school and in Tartarus, he wears the school uniform of Gekkoukan High, accented with a loose black bow tie, a neck-strap mp3 player (Sony's NW-S20x series) and clip-on earphones (Audio-Technica model ATH-EM700 SV). On weekends off he is shown wearing a light gray double-breasted jacket, dark pants and a khaki turtleneck sweater, along with his earphones. On summer days off he is shown wearing a navy blue and white T-shirt and black skinny work pants. He is never seen without his earphones except when he goes to the beach during summer vacation.</p>

        <h2>Personality</h2>
        <p>In Persona 3, the protagonist is a silent protagonist aside from technically speaking in battle in certain instances. While being a silent protagonist, he is very stoic, reserved and calm, gathered by the fact that he remains unmoved even when guns are pointed at him, as well as walking under a green sky and being surrounded by blood pools and coffins everywhere at the beginning of Persona 3. He appears very introverted, distant and aloof since he only observes the conversations of his party members and only speaks when someone is directed at him for his opinion on the matter. At one point, Yukari Takeba raises her voice at him in frustration, calling him "Mr. Perfect" and saying nothing ever fazes him. She then apologizes for her behavior; he comforts her and she says he "really is one-of-a-kind." His teacher Isako Toriumi comments that he is "kinda quiet, but real mature and intense looking (and hawt)" and that he uses proper grammar and punctuation online. Junpei Iori comments that all he does is wander around and talk to people.</p>

          <h1>Makoto Yuki's Persona: Orpheus</h1>
          <h2>History</h2>
  <p>In Greek mythology, Orpheus was the son of Thracian king Oeagrus and the muse Calliope (some versions have Orpheus' father as the god Apollo). Apollo, fond of Orpheus, gave him a small golden lyre, which he quickly mastered. Taught to sing verses by his mother, Orpheus was so skilled at making music that he was called "Master of Strings" and "Father of Songs," capable of such music that even rocks and animals would be compelled to dance.</p>

    <p>Upon the death of his wife Eurydice, Orpheus was so distraught that his mournful singing brought nymphs and gods to tears. Traveling to the underworld, he used his music to soften the hearts of Hades and Persephone, who allowed him to bring his wife back to the upper world on the condition that he walk in front and not look back until they had both arrived on the surface. In his anxiety, Orpheus forgot his warning and looked back when he alone had reached the surface, and saw his wife vanish, this time forever.</p>
    
    <p>At the time of his death, Orpheus had become an apostate, spurning all gods save for Apollo, who he thanked for his golden lyre. For this he was ripped apart by Dionysian Maenads (although according to other versions, he is ripped apart for refusing to participate in their drunken (and often cannibalistic) orgies, on account of remaining committed to his lost lover), only his head and lyre remaining. His head floated down the Hebrus, continuing to sing sad songs until it was buried on the island of Lesbos, while his lyre was carried to the sky by the muses and placed among the stars.</p>
    
    <p>True to his legend, Orpheus is the archetypal musician in literacy and lore, and he stands for foolish human folly (for turning back out of doubt) as well as sacrifice (for dying for Eurydice). The Greek word ὄρφνη orphne, means "darkness," and Greek ὀρφανός orphanos, "fatherless, orphan," from which comes English "orphan" by way of Latin.</p>

                <h1 id="yukari">Yukari Takeba</h1>
                <h2>Design</h2>
        <p>Yukari has neck-length light brown hair and brown eyes. She wears small white earrings. She is often seen with both her hands behind her back, except when holding her bow.</p>

          <p>At school and in Tartarus/Dark Hour, she wears a pink sweater jacket, a loose red ribbon, a black mini skirt, black knee-high stockings with white lines on the outer-sides (often shown with white hearts of four in more detailed settings), and a heart-shaped white choker. In Tartarus/Dark Hour, she wears two black straps on her right leg with a beige gun holster for her Evoker, as well as her SEES armband on her left bicep. In Persona 3 The Movie, both the straps and the holster are white.</p>

          <p>On the weekends and days off in the winter, she is seen wearing a long pink off-the-shoulder dress with lace-sewn patterns and fur linings over her skirt alongside a pair of tan knee-high boots with a fur trim (in media based on the movies and Dancing in Moonlight, they are colored black with front zippers instead). On the weekends and days off in summer, and in A Certain Day of Summer, she wears a pink tank top with orange straps and detail, and faded navy blue pants with white low-heeled sandals. She is never seen without her heart-shaped choker except when in a bath towel (during the July Operation only male protagonist's storyline and Kyoto at their third day), in her pink and blue two-piece swimsuit (during the beach excursion in Yakushima), or in her kimono (during both the Summer and New Year's Festivals)</p>

          <h2>Personality</h2>

          <p>Yukari's Arcana is the Lovers, which focuses on balanced, connected relationships with others and important choices; as such, her personality and story revolve mainly around her relationships. She is very popular in Gekkoukan High due to her kind nature and cheerful, positive outlook on life. However, her kindness has its limits, as she's prone to mood swings and getting annoyed over trivial things, often expressing this annoyance with sarcasm. Even though she and Junpei are friends, they seem to clash more often than not, with her even giving him an insulting nickname i.e. Stupei. Her hobbies include archery and acting for drama, and she eventually makes a career of being an actress as Pink Argus. Her favorite color is pink and she has a fondness for cutesy things such as her heart choker and even maid uniforms.</p>

          <h1>Yukari's Persona: Io</h1>
          <h2>History</h2>
  <p>According to Greek mythology, Io was the priestess to Hera, wife of Zeus, king of the gods. Zeus took a liking to her, and to avoid detection from his jealous wife, he shrouded the place where he seduced Io with clouds. Naturally, Hera was suspicious of the cloud's formation as well as Zeus' apparent absence from Mount Olympus. When she descended, she found Zeus as a white cloud alongside a beautiful heifer.</p>

    <p>Hera knew full well that the heifer was Io, turned by Zeus. To trap him, Hera demanded that Zeus give her the heifer as a present. Zeus had no choice but to present heifer Io to Hera, who assigned the multiple-eyed giant Argus Panoptes as her guard. Zeus sent Hermes to lull Argus to sleep, and he set Io free. Io fled to and made her home in Egypt when she became to be known as the goddess Isis.</p>

          <p>Junpei is usually portrayed as goofy, perverted, immature and upbeat. He fancies himself a ladies' man and frequently tries to hit on girls, with little to no success. Despite this, he is capable of being kind and caring, and he often cracks jokes and calls people "dude" to make them feel better. After school, he is typically seen indulging in his hobbies of reading manga or playing video games. His bedroom in the dorm is a complete mess with stuff scattered everywhere, as shown in a command console recording when Mitsuru suspects that there had been a robbery in his room, when that is actually what his room always looks like. He is also very reckless and hot-headed and rarely thinks things through, such as when he blindly chases after a Shadow when he, Yukari and the protagonist are on the monorail during the May full moon event, leaving the latter two to fend for themselves until they catch up to him. However, Junpei does have his sensible moments as well, such as when he repeatedly warns Yukari that going to the back alley behind Port Island Station is dangerous, when she considers it an "adventure." His Arcana is the Magician, which fits with his immature personality and tendency to act before he thinks.</p>

          <h1>Junpei's Persona: Hermes</h1>
          <h2>History</h2>
  <p>Hermes, the youngest of the Twelve Olympians, is the messenger of the gods in the ancient Greece. He is the offspring of Zeus and Maia, and also recognized as the patron of travelers, commerce, athletics, literature and poets, sometimes of healing and invention, even of thieves and liars. He was well worshiped by the ancient Greeks and apparently his figure appeared in many of their myths. As an infant, he created the first lyre, which he gifted to Apollo as compensation for stealing immortal cattle, who in return gave him the caduceus, a herald staff adorned with wings and entwined by two serpents, nowadays often used to symbolize medicine. His main task is to aid travelers on their journey, and to guide the dead to the Underworld, where he could enter or leave without any hindrance. He is known to wear a winged hat (petasos) and winged sandals (talaria). Hermes is the analogue of the Roman god, Mercurius. He has also been combined with the Egyptian god Thoth to become Hermes Trismegistus.</p>

                <h1 id="aki">Akihiko Sanada</h1>
                <h2>Design</h2>
        <p>Akihiko has short silver hair, gray eyes (hazel brown in Persona 3 The Movie), and wears a white band-aid above his left eye. Oddly enough, he still wears the bandage years later in Arena.</p>

          <p>He wears a slightly modified school uniform of the Gekkoukan High School, where he replaces the standard jacket with a red sweater vest (long-sleeved for winter, short-sleeved for summer). Additionally, he wears black gloves. He is never seen without his gloves except during the trip to Yakushima while he is on the beach and briefly during the school field trip in Kyoto. In Persona 3 The Movie, he wears a different type of gloves.</p>

          <p>His standard summer outfit consists of a red v-neck t-shirt and white pants.</p>

          <p>His winter outfit is a white jacket and a red scarf and white pants.</p>

          <h2>Personality</h2>

          <p>A cool and well-respected upperclassman, Akihiko is serious and determined, as well as cracking small jokes on small occasions. Of all members of the group, he is the most prone to sarcasm, one instance being if the protagonist talks to him while he and Junpei are taking a break from studying for first semester midterms, stating that Junpei isn't studying for his exams as Mitsuru told everyone to go back to their routines. He tends to show his excitement for a big challenge, something that eventually rubs off on Junpei. He is eager to train and fight, often to a fault. Early on in the game, when he is injured due to a fight with one of the twelve full moon Shadows, he will repeatedly express interest in fighting despite being unable to. This draws criticism from Mitsuru, who views Akihiko's eagerness to fight as if he treats their work as a game. At one point, Yukari even accuses him of caring more about having a good fight than doing the right thing. However, Akihiko is a kind young man who will go out of his way to help someone, which is shown when he was willing to take any chance to save Fuuka from Tartarus despite having never met her before, even after Junpei and Yukari pointed out that she had been there for ten days (or ten hours from her perspective) and most likely couldn't have survived.</p>

          <h2>History</h2>
  <p>Polydeuces (also known as Pollux) was the twin brother of Castor and both were known as the Dioscuri or Hero Twins. Both Castor and Polydeuces had the same mother, Leda, but Polydeuces' father was Zeus, while Castor's father was a mortal man named Tyndareus; because of this, Castor was mortal while Polydeuces was immortal. When Castor died, Polydeuces asked Zeus to let him share his own immortality with his twin to keep them together and they were transformed into the Gemini constellation.</p>

                <h1 id="mitsuru">Mitsuru Kirijo</h1>
                <h2>Design</h2>
        <p>Mitsuru has long red hair covering her left eye. The hue of her hair can sometimes appear vivid red or dark red. Her eyes are brown, although they have sometimes been portrayed with hints of red.</p>

          <p>At school and in Tartarus, she wears the Gekkoukan High uniform with personal effects: no jacket, a white blouse (long sleeve in winter & short puffy-sleeve in summer), a black skirt that goes above her knees and black knee-high high-heeled boots. On the weekends and days off, she wears a short black peacoat, a white scarf and white pants, along with her black boots. In the summer, however, she wears a white sleeveless turtleneck shirt and black pants. As with the rest of SEES, Mitsuru wears a swimsuit during the excursion at Yakushima. She is seen wearing a kimono at numerous appropriate occasions.</p>

          <h2>Personality</h2>

          <p>Mitsuru is calm, confident, mature, responsible, wise and very intelligent despite being a high school student. However, she may be interpreted as slightly arrogant, conceited, cold-hearted or overconfident. As events unfold, this may be a front of maturity, due to her assumed role as the leader of SEES. Her Persona Arcana is the Empress, which fits with the "motherly/older sisterly" role she plays in the group.</p>

          <p>Mitsuru has a streak of strict conduct. Per formal Japanese culture, Mitsuru is the only member of SEES who formally addresses her fellow club mates by their last names. Akihiko Sanada is an exception to this, as the two are good friends and have known each other since junior high. Eventually, she becomes more familiar with the other SEES members and refers to Yukari Takeba on a first-name basis, and the others' on occasion. Mitsuru is also very insistent with the team keeping their grades up, going so far as to sign them up for summer classes behind their backs. Mitsuru is also outspoken and has zero tolerance for prejudice. For example when the female protagonist is elected leader and Junpei Iori is annoyed because "he's the only guy in the group," Mitsuru sternly tells him that "Whether one is a man or woman doesn't factor into it. The responsibility falls to those who have the gift. And let me add, if you ever say or do anything to condescend to her because she's a woman..."</p>

  <p>According to legend, Penthesilea accidentally killed her sister Hippolyta, and as penance for her actions, she joined in the Trojan War, leading the Amazons to battle. She joined the war in its tenth and final year, and was said to have killed Achilles, but Zeus brought him back to life, and Achilles killed her.</p>

  <p>When the hero lifted her helm he fell in love and agreed to return her body unharmed to the Trojans for proper burial. The brutish Thersites mocked him for the mercy and, some say, gouged out Penthesilea's eye with a spear. For this Achilles slew him.</p>

  <p>Penthesileia's name means "mourned by the people" from the Greek words penthos and laôs.</p>

                <h1 id="aigis">Aigis</h1>
                <h2>Design</h2>
        <p>Aigis appears as an android with short, blond hair and dark blue eyes. Ikutsuki explains that her humanoid shape allows her to process thoughts like a human making it easier to handle a Persona. When she transfers and appears in the Gekkoukan High setting, she wears the generic female school uniform but retains her red ribbon except at the beach excursion in Yakushima, a brief school field trip in Kyoto (in which she wears a bathrobe) and the post-New Year's Day when she wears a kimono at the nearby shrine.</p>

          <p>During The Answer, she dons a new metal visor and a tactical vest that can carry spare ammunition along with an engraved gorget.</p>

          <h2>Personality</h2>

          <p>Aigis' initial personality is simply a robot designed to obey orders, although she is drawn to the protagonist and states that it is very important for her to be by his side, going so far as to hug them in front of everyone. As a result of having no emotions, Aigis' social skills are more-or-less non-existent; it's frequently noted on-screen that while she may look human, she is far from passing as such. She is prone to doing very strange and socially unacceptable things, such as breaking into the protagonist's room to wake him up and requesting to be on standby in their room, which Yukari calls her out for. A video recording shows that she has a habit of breaking into his dorm room at night in order to check on him, even going so far as to keep a record of how long it takes her to pick the lock, In Falling Down, she even goes so far as to sneak into the boy's rooms during the group's stay in Kyoto, claiming it was unfair that she and the protagonist weren't in the same room. Lack of social grace notwithstanding, Aigis is nonetheless very polite to everybody, always using the honorific '-san' when addressing them. In the original Japanese version, she often ends her sentences with "de arimasu" prior to developing emotions.</p>

          <p>She is shown to be able to understand Koromaru and often translates for the others, though she is shown to be able to understand dogs in general. She states that dogs don't have a language, but speech is not the only way of communication, with The Answer revealing that she can understand Koromaru's thoughts and feelings. Arena reveals that this is because it was inherited from the 5th Generation Anti-Shadow weapons, one of who took time to communicate with a puppy named Snowy. In Persona 4 Arena Ultimax, Aigis meets him, now an old dog.</p>

          <h1>Aigis' Persona: Palladion</h1>
          <h2>History</h2>
  <p>In Greek and Roman mythology, a palladium or palladion was an image of great antiquity on which the safety of a city was said to depend. "Palladium" especially signified the wooden statue (xoanon) of Pallas Athena that Odysseus and Diomedes stole from the citadel of Troy and which was later taken to the future site of Rome by Aeneas. The Roman story is related in Virgil's Aeneid and other works.</p>

  <p>In English, since circa 1600, the word "palladium" has meant anything believed to provide protection or safety — a safeguard.</p>

                <h2>Design</h2>
        <p>Koromaru is an albino Shiba Inu. When he joined SEES, he was given a special Evoker for dogs, a metallic collar around his neck. He has a red armband on his front left leg, a miniature white t-shirt and very small angel-esque wings on his back.</p>


          <h2>Personality</h2>

          <p>Koromaru's personality is based on the famous dog Hachikō. He is kind and has shown extreme loyalty, choosing to stay at his master's shrine long after his death and going for a walk every day like he used to with his master. He is also very protective of the shrine, as shown when he risked his life to defend it, but got seriously injured in the process. According to Aigis, he considers the shrine a sacred place.</p>

          <p>Koromaru also exhibits numerous human characteristics, despite being a dog. He exhibits intelligence far above that of most dogs. He is fiercely loyal, and particularly close with Shinjiro Aragaki, who often feeds him special food and takes extra care of him. He is a fan of a show called "The True Battles of Real Men," which exhibits acts of courage from real people. He begs the protagonist to take him to the theater for a special showing of the final episodes of the show. Koromaru whines and runs around after the movie until the protagonist agrees to purchase the boxed set after its release.</p>

          <h2>History</h2>
  <p>In Greek mythology, Cerberus, also known as Kerberos, is a monster and pet under Hades that guards the gates of the Greek underworld, the realm of Hades. It is generally depicted as a vicious, gargantuan dog with three heads, although accounts may vary. Cerberus is in fact the Latin transliteration of the Greek name Kerberos.</p>

  <p>Cerberus was one of the monsters born from the union of Echidna and Typhon, both as monstrous and hideous as their offspring. Echidna was half-woman, half-serpent, while Typhon was the most fierce of all creatures. Among his brothers, the most famous are the Lernaean Hydra, Chimera, and Orthrus.</p>

                <h1 id="ken">Ken Amada</h1>
                <h2>Design</h2>
        <p>Ken has styled short brown hair and eyes. Even as an elementary student, he is short for his age. At school and Tartarus, he wears a school uniform of Gekkoukan Elementary, with an orange jacket under his Gekkoukan jacket, and tennis shoes with white socks. On weekends off, he is seen wearing a long orange turtleneck sweater shirt with light orange sleeves and tan shorts. On the summer days off, he wears a black turtleneck shirt underneath his orange and black jersey (with an 8 in the back, referencing his Arcana) and black shorts.</p>


          <h2>Personality</h2>

          <p>Despite his young age, Ken is very intelligent and mature. It is shown that this is a coping mechanism due to the death of his mother at a young age, which more-or-less forced him to give up his childhood. His maturity is noted by Yukari, who can't believe he's in elementary school and claims that Junpei, who is a full six years older than him, could learn a thing or two from him. Fuuka also notes his maturity, and finds him cute as a result of it. Besides being mature, Ken also knows several words that boys his age don't usually know, such as "bastard," which he usually uses when referring to Strega. He is very polite to others, and never misses a chance to show respect where respect is due. He is also honest, diligent, and deeply caring towards his peers, particularly the members of SEES. Ken is shown to like and care a great deal for animals, such as Koromaru. In his video recording, there is a hamster in his room. In Persona 3 The Movie, he cares for a goldfish and in Persona 4 Arena Ultimax, it is shown that he and Koromaru are now living together.</p>

          <p>Although Ken is very mature, he still has several qualities that fit with his age and is sometimes too precocious for his own good. He finds a role-model in Akihiko, whom he admires for his boxing and fighting talents, often referring to him as "Sanada-san" as a form of respect to his senpai. He also likes to watch a children's show, Featherman R, but he prefers to keep it a secret. He seems to collect a lot of the Featherman R figurines, as well. He is also shown to be quite naive at times, such as when Junpei tricks him into believing the girls aren't wearing anything under their kimonos, which they wore on New Year's Day. Overall, Ken gives off the impression that he's just trying too hard to be something he's not i.e. an adult. Ken notes that one of the reasons he uses spears in battle is so that he'll be on even ground with an adult.</p>

          <h2>History</h2>
  <p>Nemesis, also called Rhamnousia or Rhamnusia ("the goddess of Rhamnous"), was the ancient Greek goddess of divine retribution against those who succumb to pride and arrogance. Also, she is the daughter of Erebus and Nyx.</p>

  <p>It is also believed that Nemesis produced the egg from which hatched two sets of twins: Helen of Troy and Clytemnestra, and the Dioscuri, Castor and Polydeuces. The reason they hatched from an egg is because, in order to avoid Zeus, Nemesis turns into a goose, but he turns into a swan and mates with her.</p>

  <p>One of her acts of retribution was to punish the beautiful Narcissus for spurning his many suitors. Nemesis caused him to fall in love with his own reflection in a pool of water, which led him to perish there from despair and regret.</p>

                <h1 id="shinjiro">Shinjiro Aragaki</h1>
                <h2>Design</h2>
        <p>Shinjiro is the tallest playable character in Persona 3. He has unkempt brown hair, worn perpetually under a beanie, and steel-colored eyes. He is somewhat warmly complected, a change from the generally pale cast (there is occasionally some discrepancy with his color scheme in anime cutscenes on the console versions of the game, especially regarding his skin tone).</p>

        <p>His clothing is relatively simple, consisting mainly of a maroon peacoat, black pants and brown Chelsea shoes. Persona Suppressors can cause the body to become unable to regulate body temperature, hence why Shinjiro is always wearing a coat and hat</p>

        <p>As seen in his dialogue portraits, Shinjiro typically has a "shifty" look about him. He often has his hands in his pockets and his head held low, eyes cast off to the side.</p>


          <h2>Personality</h2>

          <p>A reliable and serious character whose cold exterior masks his weaker, gentler self, Shinjiro's difficult past weighs him down, causing him to constantly push others away with a tough-guy act. He has given up being a member of SEES to live a normal life, even though there are only so many Persona-users and so S.E.E.S. needs all the help they can get, something even Yukari, who has no love for S.E.E.S. or the Dark Hour, has the sense to realize. As he points out to Akihiko, both of them are held back by the guilt of their pasts; they just have completely different ways of dealing with it.</p>

          <p>Various parts of Shinjiro's personality are revealed in the different versions of Persona 3, and he is (like most other male characters) difficult to know when playing the male protagonist's route. In FES / Portable, the dorm recordings show an event regarding Shinjiro's "other side." He is revealed to love dogs, in particular Koromaru, who he spoils; in the same scene, he is shown to be an avid cook that enjoys learning from cooking shows.</p>

          <h2>History</h2>
  <p>Castor was the twin brother of Polydeuces and part of the Argonauts. Both Castor and Polydeuces had the same mother, Leda, but Polydeuces' father was Zeus, while Castor's father was a mortal man named Tyndareus; because of this, Castor was mortal while Polydeuces was immortal. When Castor died, Polydeuces requested to share his immortality with him, and they became the Gemini constellation</p>
