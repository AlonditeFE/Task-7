    <h1>Welcome to the Velvet Room!</h1>
    
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Welcome to the home page of my project. I chose to make a small database for my favorite game Persona 3. I took my information and pictures from the <a href="https://megamitensei.fandom.com/wiki/Megami_Tensei_Wiki">Megami Tensei Wiki</a> and do not claim to own any of the assets used in making this site. This is nothing more than passion project.(Which i just so happen to be making before turning it into a CSC 225 project.) I plan to add more to this project in the future.</p>

        <p>At the top of the screen you can see navigation buttons to move from this home page to the Persona 3 page and the form page. On the Persona 3 page you will see an overview of the plot, a description of each character and their persona as well as the skills that persona can learn. The form page will allow you to fill out a quick form as the name implies</p>
